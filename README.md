🚀 Approach & Technical Implementation:-

           Development Philosophy
I built DocSummit with a clear vision: create an intuitive document summarization tool that feels magical yet remains technically robust. The core intuition was to balance powerful AI capabilities with a seamless user experience, ensuring even non-technical users could benefit from advanced document processing.

          Technical Flow & Architecture
Step 1: Client-Side Processing First
I implemented all file processing directly in the browser using pdf.js for PDF extraction and Tesseract.js for OCR. This deliberate choice ensures user privacy—documents never leave their device until absolutely necessary for AI processing.

Step 2: Intelligent AI Integration
When users request summaries, only extracted text is sent to Google's Gemini API. I designed a smart caching system that stores generated summaries to avoid redundant API calls, reducing costs and improving response times.

Step 3: Responsive UI Architecture
The React-based interface uses a state-driven design that provides immediate visual feedback. The tab system for different summary lengths creates an exploratory environment where users can discover their preferred detail level.

Step 4: Error Resilience
I implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline—from file validation to API communication—ensuring graceful degradation rather than confusing failures.

🔥 The application flow mirrors natural document processing: upload → extract → understand → refine. This intuitive progression makes advanced AI technology accessible while maintaining technical excellence under the hood.
